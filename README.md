### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Alex. I've worked on games. I like working on games. Here is some game related stuff I've done:
- Shipped Kill It With Fire VR on [PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1179210/Kill_It_With_Fire/), [Quest](https://www.meta.com/experiences/5057690021017445/), [PS4, and PS5](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005532) while working at Charm Games as a co-op student
- Coded, designed, drew, and released a Metroidvania on Steam [(PSYCRON)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1368410/PSYCRON/)
- Developed a custom cloud build pipeline for both Unreal Engine 4/5 titles built with AWS EC2 runners and CircleCI that built, cooked, & deployed to PC/Quest/Consoles

Currently I'm working on a tiny C# game engine made with [FNA](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA). No interesting public repositories to show at the moment, sorry!
